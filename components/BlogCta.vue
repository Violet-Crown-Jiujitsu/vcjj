            <p>Austin is such a fun city. Lots of activities to participate in. Q2 soccer stadium
              is down the road from our academy in North Austin. We are surrounded by so much good

            <p>We've all been there. 5 months into training and you are ready to step it up. The
              idea of learning an advanced submission to catch the other white belts is a thrill
              and exciting, as you should be. All of these thoughts ran through all current BJJ
