            <p>Austin is such a fun city. &nbsp;Lots of activities to participate in. &nbsp;Q2 soccer stadium is

            <p>We've all been there. 5 months into training and you are ready to step it up. &nbsp;The idea of
              learning an advanced submission to catch the other white belts is a thrill and exciting, as you should
              be. &nbsp;All of these thoughts ran through all current BJJ Black Belts minds at white belt. And most
