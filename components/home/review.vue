                I've trained at several schools in the area and violet crown is hands down my favorite! Great community,
                friendly neighborhood vibes, and most importantly top notch instruction. Couldn't recommend it enough.

                If you're looking for a gym that provides top notch instruction along with a safe and fun environment, I
                can't recommend this gym enough. Rudy and the gang have done a tremendous job in developing my game. I
                always look forward to coming in to train. Highly Recommend!

                Rudy is an outstanding coach! I have finally started to feel at home in jiu jitsu since joining here.
                Love this place.
