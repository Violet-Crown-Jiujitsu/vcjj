    title: 'Do I have to be in good shape to study Muay Thai?',
    content: `<p>
                No. In fact, Muay Thai is one of the best workouts you can do to get in shape if you’re not happy with
                your current fitness level. It works your entire body. Over time, you can increase the intensity of your
                workouts to continue to challenge your body.

  },
  {
    title: 'Will Muay Thai workouts help me lose weight?',
    content: `<p>
                Yes. However, it is important to combine Muay Thai with a healthy diet and lifestyle if you want your
                body to be lean and strong. Muay Thai burns a lot of calories but you may have problems if you eat a
                diet high in sugar and processed foods.
              </p>`,
  },
  {
    title: 'Is Muay Thai good for self-defense?',
    content: `<p>
                Yes. Muay Thai teaches students to leverage their own body weight as well as their opponent’s weight.
                Students learn practical moves that are ideal for self-defense – and Muay Thai also builds good
                reflexes, which are essential in a fight.
              </p>`,
  },
  {
    title: 'Is Muay Thai dangerous?',
    content: ` <p>
                Muay Thai is not dangerous for beginners, especially if you wear the proper equipment. If you choose to
                compete, there is some risk of injury. Here again, though, proper protection can help you minimize
                injuries in the ring.

              Getting into shape can be a challenge if you don’t work your entire body. Studying Muay Thai uses all
              major muscle groups, helping to give you the strength, flexibility, and stamina you need.

            There are plenty of workouts you could try, but it can be difficult choosing the one that’s going to give
            you the greatest health benefits and best results. If you want to lose weight, you’ll also want to choose a
            workout that will help you burn a large number of calories and tone your muscles at the same time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The workout you choose should do everything you want it to do – from toning your muscles to improving your
            cardiovascular health and reducing stress.

          <h2>YOU WILL GROW WITH EVERY CLASS!</h2>
          <p>
            Muay Thai combines the discipline and focus of martial arts with an intense, body-toning workout that can
            help you lose weight, improve your cardiovascular health, and minimize your stress and anxiety.

          <p>
            We all have times when we fall into a workout rut. We go to the gym, but we aren’t getting the same results
            we used to see.
          </p>
          <p>
            One problem may be that you’re doing a workout that doesn’t challenge your entire body. Muay Thai workouts
            require students to use every major muscle group – and that means it delivers a great workout every time.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to providing an intense workout, Muay Thai builds muscles and tones your entire body. It’s the
            workout you’ve been looking for.

          <h2 class="module-title">MUAY THAI BURN CALORIES AND FAT</h2>
          <p>
            The secret to losing weight is finding a way to burn more calories each day than you take in. For most
            people, that means getting regular exercise to burn some of what they eat.
          </p>
          <p>
            A single Muay Thai workout can burn as much as a thousand calories. That means that your body will easily
            burn more calories than you take in, leading to a net loss of weight.
          </p>
          <p>
            And, Muay Thai increases muscle mass. Since muscle burns more calories than fat does, regular Muay Thai
            workouts can boost your metabolism, making it easy to lose weight.

          <h2 class="module-title">MAINTAIN FLEXIBILITY AND STRENGTH AS YOU AGE</h2>
          <p>
            As people age, they tend to lose flexibility in their joints and may find that they lose strength as well.
            Experiencing a physical decline can limit your ability to do the things you love.
          </p>
          <p>
            People who practice Muay Thai reinforce their body’s strength and flexibility with each workout. By
            emphasizing core strength and overall fitness, Muay Thai can help you combat the aging process.
          </p>
          <p>Just as importantly, Muay Thai people of all fitness levels and ages can benefit from Muay Thai.</p>

          <h2 class="module-title">MUAY THAI BANISHES STRESS AND ANXIETY</h2>
          <p>
            Stress is a part of modern life. It can have a negative impact on your physical, emotional, and mental
            health if you don’t find ways to minimize it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working out regularly releases feel-good hormones called endorphins. Muay Thai workouts will help you
            maintain the proper hormonal balance so you can cope with stress as it arises.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, Muay Thai can also make you feel better about yourself and your body, which contributes to
            good mental health and makes it less likely that stress will affect you.
